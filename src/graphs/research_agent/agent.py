"""Declarative agent assembly — paradigm B (composed agent).

Set SANDBOX_PROVIDER (local|daytona|e2b) to give the agent a real shell:
the sandbox becomes the default backend and skill scripts become runnable.

No explicit topology: the agent loop is provided by deepagents; behavior is
shaped by composing capabilities (tools, subagents, middleware, backend).
Contrast with paradigm A (shopping_agent) where the topology is explicit.

Skills ship as data in ``skills/`` and are served read-only through a
CompositeBackend: ``/skills/`` routes to the package directory, everything
else goes to the ephemeral state backend (the agent's scratch space).
User-tier skills from the skill hub are materialized per run into that
scratch space under ``/user-skills/`` by SkillRouterMiddleware.
